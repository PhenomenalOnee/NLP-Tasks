Sonnet Selected is:
 From fairest creatures we desire increase That thereby beauty’s rose might never die But as the riper should by time decease His tender heir might bear his memory But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes Feed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel Making a famine where abundance lies Thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel Thou that art now the world’s fresh ornament And only herald to the gaudy spring Within thine own bud buriest thy content And tender churl mak’st waste in niggarding Pity the world or else this glutton be To eat the world’s due by the grave and thee 

RECOMMENDED SONNETS ARE:

How can my muse want subject to invent While thou dost breathe that pour’st into my verse Thine own sweet argument too excellent For every vulgar paper to rehearse? O give thy self the thanks if aught in me Worthy perusal stand against thy sight For who’s so dumb that cannot write to thee When thou thy self dost give invention light? Be thou the tenth Muse ten times more in worth Than those old nine which rhymers invocate And he that calls on thee let him bring forth Eternal numbers to outlive long date If my slight muse do please these curious days The pain be mine but thine shall be the praise 


O call not me to justify the wrong That thy unkindness lays upon my heart Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue Use power with power and slay me not by art Tell me thou lov’st elsewhere but in my sight Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside What need’st thou wound with cunning when thy might Is more than my o’erpressed defence can bide? Let me excuse thee ah my love well knows Her pretty looks have been mine enemies And therefore from my face she turns my foes That they elsewhere might dart their injuries Yet do not so but since I am near slain Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain

Sonnet Selected is:
 Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest Now is the time that face should form another Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest Thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother For where is she so fair whose uneared womb Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry? Or who is he so fond will be the tomb Of his self-love to stop posterity? Thou art thy mother’s glass and she in thee Calls back the lovely April of her prime So thou through windows of thine age shalt see Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time But if thou live remembered not to be Die single and thine image dies with thee 

RECOMMENDED SONNETS ARE:

Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove O no it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken It is the star to every wand’ring bark Whose worth’s unknown although his height be taken Love’s not Time’s fool though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle’s compass come Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks But bears it out even to the edge of doom If this be error and upon me proved I never writ nor no man ever loved 


Whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will And Will to boot and Will in overplus More than enough am I that vex thee still To thy sweet will making addition thus Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine? Shall will in others seem right gracious And in my will no fair acceptance shine? The sea all water yet receives rain still And in abundance addeth to his store So thou being rich in will add to thy will One will of mine to make thy large will more Let no unkind no fair beseechers kill Think all but one and me in that one Will
