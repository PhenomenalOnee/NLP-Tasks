**I have provided  two .py files and two output files**

1)Emotion Analysis File: This program is used to detect text based sentiment. Five classes/sentiments used for classisfication are: Sad,Angry,Happy,Nervous,Disgusted.
			    I have made a Menu Driven Program offering user to select the approach for sentiment analysis. I Have used two Algorithms: RNN Based and TFIDF 
			    Vector based approach.
			    The output for this program is saved in "Output(For Sentiment Analysis)" file.

2)Pos&NEg emotion Analysis File: This program is used to detect negative and positive emotions from text. Here I have used RNN approach.
				  The output for this program is saved in "Output(For NEgative&POstive emotions)" file
