
Following is a program output for text-based Sentiment Analysis.
Five Sentiments are Used for classification:
Sadness, Anger, Happiness, Nervousness, Disgust

Note: The dataset I have Used does not have much variations and 
diversity in terms of words used.
Hence Accuracy is not state-of-the-art.
